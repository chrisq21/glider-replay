V2 ----------------------------------------------------------

- Smooth out camera
  - Don't follow every curve if possible

- Array prep
  * Prevent jumps by only moving camera position if it's a certain distance from previous position.
  * remove parts of array where there's little to no movement. Ex pre-launch, sometimes sits too long in one spot
