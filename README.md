TODO

- Array prep
  * Prevent jumps by only moving camera position if it's a certain distance from previous position.
  * remove parts of array where there's little to no movement. Ex pre-launch, sometimes sits too long in one spot


Notes

- Controls concepts
  3 types of controls concepts
    1) Plane controls (play, pause, speed)
    2) Camera controls (follow, stop following, determine other controls)
    3) Animation timeline( use elevation graph as clickable track)
